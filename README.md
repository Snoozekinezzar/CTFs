# CTF Challenge Write-ups

Welcome to my repository of write-ups for various CTF challenges I've tackled. Here, you'll find detailed explanations, walkthroughs, and insights into the thought process behind each solution.

## About CTFs

Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are games that test participants' information security skills. They're a great way to learn a wide array of cybersecurity skills and understand the practical aspects of security concepts. CTFs typically consist of a series of challenges that participants must solve to "capture" a flag, which is typically a string of text.

## How to Use This Repository

You can navigate through the directories to find the CTF event and the challenge of interest. In each challenge folder, you will typically find:

- A `README.md` file named after the specific challenge which inside contains the write-up with a detailed explanation.
- Any scripts, tools, or files that were used or discovered during the challenge are mentioned in the writeup.
- Screenshots or additional resources, if applicable.

## Contributing

While these write-ups are based on my own experiences, contributions are welcome! If you have a better solution or see an error, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
